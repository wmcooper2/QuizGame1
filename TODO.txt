TODO
----


game.py
-------
* move the functions that control line behavior to the util.Line class.
* players are always running because Player.game_just_started is not reset to False. 



objects.py
----------
* if a player's index is 3 or more away from its new index, then it should run there.



items.py
--------
* postpone the falling object mechanics for now. To speed up a working a prototype, just "pop" the item off with magic from yammy?
* when the item list is reduced, add new items. (later have luigi kick them from the edge?)
